To remove the Raspberry Pi boot-up logo, image, and text, you'll need to modify the boot configuration file. Here's how you can do it:

Access the command line interface on your Raspberry Pi. You can either connect a keyboard and monitor directly or use SSH to access it remotely.

Open the boot configuration file by running the following command:

 
 
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt


Locate the following section in the file:
 
 
logo.nologo console=tty1
Remove the logo.nologo parameter. It disables the Raspberry Pi logo during boot.

Press Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter to save the changes and exit the text editor.




Next, edit the Raspberry Pi splash screen configuration file by running the command:


sudo nano /usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/pix.script

In the file, you'll find a section that looks like this:

 
message_sprite = Sprite();
message_sprite.SetPosition(screen_width * 0.1, screen_height * 0.9, 10000);



Comment out or delete these lines to remove the boot text. It should look like this:

 
#message_sprite = Sprite();
#message_sprite.SetPosition(screen_width * 0.1, screen_height * 0.9, 10000);


Press Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter to save the changes and exit the text editor.

Reboot your Raspberry Pi for the changes to take effect by running the command:

Copy code
sudo reboot
