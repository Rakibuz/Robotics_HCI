[TUTORIAL] Simplest Way to Remove Boot Text On The Raspberry Pi
We all have been there, the embarrasment when our kiosk or digital signage display goes into reboot or crashes and display shows raspberry pi boot-up text. With these couple of steps you can remove those and have clean black background.
CAUTION: This is tested on Raspberry Pi3+. Other versions may work but we havenâ€™t tested. Please try this first on your testing unit. Tinkering with cmdline.txt might cause you the unknown amount of wasted time and headache.




Set screen black on boot:
Type into the terminal:

sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt



add this to the end of the first line:

consoleblank=1 logo.nologo quiet loglevel=0 plymouth.enable=0 vt.global_cursor_default=0 plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles splash fastboot noatime nodiratime noram




[IMPORTANT] Make sure it is all on the same line or else it will break your boot sequence!!!

Disable large rainbow screen on initial boot
Type into the terminal:

sudo nano /boot/config.txt


Add Row to the end:

disable_splash=1


Type into the terminal:

sudo reboot
And that is it. You should now have a clean kiosk or digital signage display.
